### The problem
"Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?"

### Whats this program shows
This program runs through the problem with your guess being completely random and the car door being completely random. The default run through amount is 100000 times but you can specify a custom one by passing it in as an arg. This program then prints out the result of the simulation (win rate for each side and each sides win occurrence for the giving amount of times to run for).
